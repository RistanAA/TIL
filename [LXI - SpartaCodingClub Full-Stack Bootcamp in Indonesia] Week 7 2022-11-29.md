# Day 4 
Today we just focusing to our team task and my question is What role do ORM like Sequelize, and Database like MySQL have respectively? 
and my answer is Sequelize is a ORM library to connecting our node.js project with RDMS like MySQL. this library not only to connecting to database, but also to perform function like handling database records such as migration, model and seeder.

In node.js Sequelize role is to make our javascript code to be able to communicate with the database, so we can do any SQL query by using javascript code in our node project.

i can say it something like artisan in laravel, we can use artisan to make model, migration, and also seeder. And we can do that too in sequelize by calling 
npx sequelize db:migrate (to run the migration)
