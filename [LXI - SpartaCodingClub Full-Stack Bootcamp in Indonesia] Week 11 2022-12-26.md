In last weekend we already have some meeting ( with designer too ) to discussing the project idea. 
There are our idea :

1. Quartet Card
2. Open donation for animals
3. Pinterest for animals
4. Home services (penghubung pemilik rumah dengan kontak servis listrik, air, dsb)
5. Thrifting Shop Search Engine

but in the end we choose open donation for animals

This web has 3 main feature; donating, report, adopt
