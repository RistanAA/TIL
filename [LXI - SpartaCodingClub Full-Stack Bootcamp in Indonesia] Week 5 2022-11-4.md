# Day 4
After our team dividing the task in weekends, today we merge all of our code in github and still working to finish this project.

In mentoring session, i asked about session for our project and mentor said that we cant save any progress when we refresh the page while we only using redux for login. so he recommend us to use redux persist to store in local storage. and i asked him for my login page, i want to hide/cancel the form if we click somewhere outside the form, then he recommend to use onclick event to handle that.
