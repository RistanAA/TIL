# Day 7 of week 2
This week we are learning the basic of react form component, props, state, and handling repetitive components(array.map). The lecture video is very helpful for me to understand with giving some example every topic. One topic that make me interest is immutability. i have already read and watch some video about immutability lately.
What i get is immutability is we should not modify state directly, we need to make a copy from it then we can modify it, if we not do that it will break our state that maybe used in many components.

### Team Task
In this week, the team task is not a project, but we need answer some question. at first we are disccussing the question one by one, i asking some question to my teammates that already use react before.

### Personal Task
The task is making a todo list app using react, in the end of lecture video, we've been taught how to make a todo list, but for the personal task, we need to add more features ('done', 'delete','cancel'). the tricky one is the done delete, the first thing that i think is i need to make another state to store the todo list that set to be 'done'. but after talking to the mentors, there is a simple way to do that, by creating paramater like 'isDone' and just filter when we want to show it using condition if isDone is true.

### What needs to improve ?
i think, i still not good for styling component. so i must learn more about that !!
