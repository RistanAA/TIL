Today i just started the backend side, creating register and login api.

For the database we use mongodb, because it will easier to deploy.

Today i also try to learn about useMemo for handling time like mentor said before, but i think it not match with the current function that i have.
sIn the useMemo the function (first parameter) will be run and React will memoize the value returned from that function (each time the array of dependencies change) quite similar with useEffect, 

### Tomorrow goals
* Combine our project (quite hard to communicate with the other team member)
* create admin page and the api for content management
