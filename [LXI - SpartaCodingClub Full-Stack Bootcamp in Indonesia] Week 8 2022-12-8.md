# Day 7
We have some trouble while trying to merge our progress on git for deploying, so we cant deploy it yet. 

### This week experience
this week we try to clone twitter from ali's last team project with using node.js and sequelize as backend.
First we try to design the erd for helping us to determine what the database needed

after that we write down the api that we will use with the requirement and its respond.

while doing the back end side, i personally doesnt get any big error or problem, but when i trying to connect to the front end , i get some error that i dont know why it turn to errors.

Theres a error that i cant fix, when i click the heart button , my expectation is it will turn into pink color where i click the button. but the result is the color has changed but after that it will back to initial again. but if i click at the last post it just working fine

### what could i do better
* make a better allocation work for all the team members
* spend more time for the project
