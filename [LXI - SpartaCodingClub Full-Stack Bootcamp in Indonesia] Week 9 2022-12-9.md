# Day 1
Today we have special session with our mentors

### Mentoring with mentor Justin
We discussing about authentication, 

what i get is :
* We should hashing user password
  It just make our data more secure
* we should using local storage than cookies
  By using local storage, the data is only can be access by it's computer or app but if we use cookies any app that get access to browser can access it.
  And also local storage can be used in any app not only browser (mobile, smart tv, etc)
* Redux store only for global data
  this is simple and we already know from the first lecture about redux, but recently i forgot. i always storing the data that i get from api to redux and actualy make it more complicated.
