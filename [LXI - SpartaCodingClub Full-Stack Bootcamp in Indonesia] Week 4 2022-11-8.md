# Day 5
In week end we have leacture video that learning about :

### Redux tool kit 
Redux Toolkit package is intended to be the standard way to write Redux logic. It was originally created to help address three common concerns about Redux:

* Configuring a Redux store is too complicated
* I have to add a lot of packages to get Redux to do anything useful
* Redux requires too much boilerplate code

### JSON Server
JSON server is quick back-end for prototyping and mocking that we can use to implement the api without using real database.

### Axios
Axios is promise-based http client for node.js and browsers. In other words, you can think of it as a package used to communicate with the server using http.

### Thunk 
Middleware has since been used in Redux applications to perform asynchronous tasks .Redux ThunkÂ middleware allows you to write action creators that return a function instead of an action. The thunk can be used to delay the dispatch of an action, or to dispatch only if a certain condition is met.
