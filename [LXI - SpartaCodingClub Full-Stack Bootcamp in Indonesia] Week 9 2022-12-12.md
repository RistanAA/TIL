# Day 1
Today we start week 9 (mini project), and we decide to make A web based ‘memory game’ that search and match the image in a list of image, if the player can match a image he will get a point and if not it will reset. The game will play in certain time limit and if the time is over, the player’s point will send to database and there will a leaderboard feature to comparing the players points. This project will be more focus in frontend side to make good design and animation because this is “game” , but in backend side will cover  user data, result of the game, and maybe will add some admin to handle the game settings like adding new image, quantity of image, set time limit, etc
