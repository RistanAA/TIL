When i try to like a post, the like icon is not showing right, but the backend api works fine

today i just trying to fix that problem, but still not fully fix it so i'll try to do the other feature first, then i try to fix it tomorrow.

### What i learn today
I discusing with ali about using token for our authentication. firstly we use back end cookies to store the token, but we decide to store the token in the front cookie then passing it to back end through api.

### tomorrow goals
* Finish the project
