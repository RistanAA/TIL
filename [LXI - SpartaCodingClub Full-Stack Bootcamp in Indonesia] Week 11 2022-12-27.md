And also i learn to use firebase, i try to make some simple crud with using firebase, it has some different for querying to database than using mongoose.

like when we try to adding new row to database we can use add() and while try to retrieve data like using find or findOne in mongoose we can use get() to handle that, but the difference is we need to store the data in some value the add it from data that we get before using .data()

but we at the end we decided to use mongo to store the data and firebase for image.

### Tommorow goals
