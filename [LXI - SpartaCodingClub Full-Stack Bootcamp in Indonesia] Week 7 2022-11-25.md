After that we are discussing about the video and picking 2 question from the video,
i suggest to ask 'finally' statement in try catch, then ali suggest to ask about hoisting

### What i learn today
* object

* class
class is like a tamplate of the object, we can use class to create a new object base on templates

* destructuring for get the variable from the object/array without declaring it one by one

* error handling (try,catch,finally)
* method is function inside the object
* hoisting is like wherever we declare the variable (var, function) it will hoisted to the top and get declared so it will not return system error but just return undifined

### Tomorrow Goals
* watch and learn the lecture video
