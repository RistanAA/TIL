# SpartaCodingClub Full-Stack Bootcamp in Indonesia, 2022/10/26 TIL / Week 2

Today i just focusing my personal task, i think i already meet all the requirement.
* clear input after adding new list
* delete item in list
* moving the item to done list when we click done button

### what did i do well ?
Today i also searching about immutability in react, reading and watching about that.
I think immutability in react we shouldn't to make a direct change to any object or array because they are mutable. so we must make a copy of object or array and do any changes in that.

that is my code when i try to implement the immutability

### what needs to improve
* i'm not good in designing the website, usually i just using bootsrap tamplate in html for creating any view. maybe i will try to designing component by component next time.
