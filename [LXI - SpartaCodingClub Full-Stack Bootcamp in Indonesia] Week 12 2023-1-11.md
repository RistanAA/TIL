When try to use api from backend server that deployed in vercel, i get cors problem. i try to figure out what is the problem. i already use cors middleware in backend and it should fix the proble. and after searching in the internet maybe it is the vercel problem so i got some solution to add some code in vercel.json, but the vercel bot in github reject it, because we cant use header in vercel.json. i will try to fix it again tomorrow.
